      <p>CMJD was fully designed for UNDERGRADUATE students who are studying in Government and Private Universities to
        enhance the knowledge and skills of software developments to the industry standards and also giving marvellous
        software development training enabling modern software design and developing methodologies (architectural
        designs and using depth of object orientation) to fill the gap between
        students and current IT job requirements.</p>
      <p>Even though plenty of theory subjects have been studied in the universities, students are not able to match
        their primary qualification to get into the IT industry, therefore IJSE introduced this program for the students
        to fulfill their expectation. According to the past statistics of IJSE, more than 4500 undergraduate students
        have been produced to IT Industry Island wide.</p>
